                At PapaKoala, we believe that what happens in the family stays in the family. We designed our technology with privacy as a foundational pillar, not an afterthought.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Executive Summary (For busy parents)</h3>
            <ul class="my-6 space-y-3">
                <li><strong>We do not sell your data.</strong> Ever.</li>
                <li><strong>Your photos and baby data are yours.</strong> They are stored on your device and in your personal iCloud account. We (the developer) have no access to them.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparent business model.</strong> We make money by selling a premium subscription, not by selling your information to advertisers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-12">2. Data Controller</h3>
            <p>
                The entity responsible for the operation of the PapaKoala app and the papakoala.com website is the PapaKoala development team (hereinafter "We"), based in Spain. You can contact us for any legal questions at <a href="mailto:hola@papakoala.com">hola@papakoala.com</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-12">3. Data We Collect (and Data We DON'T)</h3>
            
            <h4 class="text-brandDark">A. User-Generated Data (Photos, Names, Dates)</h4>
            <p>
                All personal information you enter into the app (baby's name, birth date, profile photo, milestones achieved) is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> and synchronized exclusively via your private <strong>Apple iCloud</strong> account.
            </p>
            <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-2xl border-l-4 border-brandIndigo shadow-sm my-6">
                <p class="m-0 font-medium text-brandDark">
                    <strong>Important:</strong> We do not have our own servers hosting this information. We cannot see your baby's photo or know their name. You have total control.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4 class="text-brandDark">B. Subscription Data</h4>
            <p>
                To manage your Premium access, we use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> and <strong>Apple StoreKit</strong>. These services process an anonymous identifier of your user to know if your subscription is active. We do not process your bank or credit card details; Apple handles the entire payment securely.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-brandDark">C. Web Browsing Data</h4>
            <p>
                On our website (papakoala.com), we use <strong>Google Analytics</strong> with IP anonymization to understand how to improve our page (e.g., knowing which pages are visited most). We do not use this data for aggressive advertising retargeting.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-12">4. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>The application uses trusted services to function correctly:</p>
            <ul class="space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Apple iCloud:</strong> To sync your data between your iPad/iPhone devices. <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple Policy</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> To manage your subscription status. <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RevenueCat Policy</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-12">5. Your Rights (GDPR & CCPA)</h3>
            <p>Since your personal data resides on your device and in your iCloud, you exercise your rights directly:</p>
            <ul class="space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Access and Portability:</strong> You can view all your data by opening the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to be Forgotten (Deletion):</strong> If you wish to delete your data, simply delete the application from your device and remove the iCloud backup if desired. Since we do not have servers with your data, you do not need to request deletion from us: deleting the app removes the data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-12">6. Children's Privacy (COPPA)</h3>
            <p>
                Our application is not directed at children under 13, but at their parents and guardians. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children on our servers. All information about the child is entered by the parent/guardian and remains under their strict control on their personal device.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-12">7. Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                On the website, we use essential technical cookies and analytical cookies (Google Analytics). You can configure your browser to reject these cookies, although some website functions might be affected. The app does not use advertising cookies.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-12">8. Medical Disclaimer</h3>
            <div class="bg-brandIndigo/10 p-8 rounded-3xl border border-brandIndigo/20 not-prose text-base leading-relaxed">
                <p class="font-bold text-brandIndigo text-lg mb-3">⚕️ Important Health Notice</p>
